Bluetooth with Solidrun HummingBoard2 v1.5
-------------------------------------------

The Hummingboard2 have a combo wifi/bluetooth TI wl18xx module.

To enable the bluetooth part you need to attach the bluettoh stack to the
serial port associated to bluetooth component:
	/usr/bin/hciattach /dev/ttymxc3 texas 3000000 flow
